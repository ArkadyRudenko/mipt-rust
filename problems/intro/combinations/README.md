# Combinations

## Task

Implement the `combinations` function that takes some slice and the `k` parameter and returns a vector of all possible combinations of `k` elements. Just use recursion and some loops.

**Note**: the indices of combinations' elements must be in lexicographical order.

## Tips

- You'll need to use [Vec](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html) and its slices to solve this problem. Check the methods `insert`, `is_empty`.

## Advanced level

Try not to use loops at all. You'll need to learn about iterators for that.
